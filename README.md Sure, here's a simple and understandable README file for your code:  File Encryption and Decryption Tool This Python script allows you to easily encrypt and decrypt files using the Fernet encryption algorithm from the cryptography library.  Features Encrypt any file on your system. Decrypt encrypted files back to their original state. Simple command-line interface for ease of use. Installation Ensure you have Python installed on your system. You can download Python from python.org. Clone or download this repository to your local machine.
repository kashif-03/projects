Learning
know the concepts of encryption and decrption
encryption - a plain text converted to cipher text using key(genreated by crptographic algortihm for encryption)is known as encrytpion
decryption - a cipher text converted to plain text using key(genreated by crptographic algortihm for encryption) is known as decryption
